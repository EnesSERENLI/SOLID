# SOLID

## SOLID software principles; It is a set of principles that ensure that the developed software is flexible, reusable, sustainable and understandable, and prevents code duplication.

# SOLID Principle

## 1-[*SingleResponsibility*](https://github.com/EnesSERENLI/SOLID/tree/main/(S)ingle%20Responsibility%20Principle)

### Objects or methods must be open to expansion, but closed to relocations.
### Thus, we should solve the problems by making new additions to the existing codes, not by changing the previously written codes.

## 2-[*Open-Closed*](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*UhvaCg9qOCYZyDJZh180hQ.png)

### Objects should be interchangeable with their own sub-properties without causing problems while the program is running.
### Derived classes must use all the properties of the base class. Thus, unnecessary code stack is not created.

## 3-[*LiskovSubstitution*](https://github.com/EnesSERENLI/SOLID/tree/main/(L)%C4%B0skov's%20Substititon%20Principle)

### Objects should be interchangeable with their own sub-properties without causing problems while the program is running.

## 4-[*InterfaceSegregation*](https://github.com/EnesSERENLI/SOLID/tree/main/(I)nterface%20Segregation%20Principe)

### Objects should be separated from interfaces they do not need as much as possible.
### There should be no unused or unnecessary features.

## 5-[*DependencyInversion*](https://github.com/EnesSERENLI/SOLID/tree/main/(D)ependency%20Inversion%20Principle)

### High-level classes should not depend on low-level classes. Changes made to subclasses should not affect superclasses.

### Instead of creating a huge one-piece class, it is necessary to create small pieces that do their own thing.
